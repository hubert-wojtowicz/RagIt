## Introduction

Explain briefly what your project is about and why it's useful. Mention that it allows pulling in different data sources and performing similarity search.

## WIP

Stuff that I need to do.
- put all in docker compose to run stuff simply with `docker-compose up` command.
- select vector database with similarity search implementation
- pulling in text documents from provided catalog three specified with path to root
- pulling in list of links
- think about integrations with dataset that are hidden behing some authorization (pluggable api resource)
- maybe employ Spectr.IO as consol (later)
